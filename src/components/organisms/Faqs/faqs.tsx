    answer:
      'There are three stages of Thalassemia:\n1) *Thalassemia minor*: this is normal and includes only mild anemia\n2) *Thalassemia intermedia*: requires occasional blood transfusions and may benefit from medication\n3) *Thalassemia major*: Severe anemia, needs regular blood transfusions in order to survive. Bone marrow translate can also be considered. This is severe and can be categorized into two types\n - _Alpha Thalassemia_: occurs when a gene or genes related to the alpha globin protein are missing or changed\n - _Beta Thalassemia_:  occurs when similar gene defects affect production of the beta globin protein'

You may believe that your blood has been tested for this specific gene but testing for thalassemia requires a special blood test. To be tested your doctor must order a blood test called HEMOGLOBIN ELECTROPHORESIS which can identify a carrier of thalassemia. \n\nIf you, your parents or ancestors are from an area of the world where thalassemia is common, PLEASE REQUEST hemoglobin electrophoresis blood test from your doctor. \n\nIt is important to identify yourself as a possible carrier of thalassemia (thalassemia minor). A person with thalassemia minor has a 25%(1 in 4) chance of having a baby with thalassemia major if his/her mate also has thalassemia minor.'
